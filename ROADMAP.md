## ‚û°Ô∏è Now: Core Gameplay Loop (v0.1)
This milestone is focused on building the absolute minimum viable product (MVP) with a playable core loop.
- **Core Mechanics**:
  - [x] Let the Player use Workers to build Farms.
  - [x] Farms produce Food at the start of each round.
    [Issue #4](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/issues/4)
  - [x] Food has to move to the City to give the Player money.
    [Issue #11](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/issues/11)
  - [ ] Let the Player change Laborer assignments.
    [Issue #19](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/issues/19)
  - [ ] Let the Player hire more Workers and Laborers.
    [Issue #18](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/issues/18)
- **UI Elements**: Add the most essential user interface elements, like letting the Player move the Units and perform actions and see territory claims on each Tile.
  [Issue #6](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/issues/6)
  [Issue #22](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/issues/22)

## üîú Next: Minimum Viable Product (v0.2)
After the core loop is solid, we can add other UI/UX elements necessary for a Minimum Viable Product:
- Title Screen
- Main Menu
- Settings Screen
- Improved and expanded game UI

## üÜï Then: Expanding the World (v0.3)
 we'll start adding more content and expanding the game world.
- Ranches
- Mines
- Marshes

## üåü Later: (v0.4+)
Start working on unified graphics design and sounds.
