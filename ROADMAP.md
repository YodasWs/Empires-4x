# üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap
Welcome to the roadmap for Empires 4X! This document provides an overview of our development plans and direction. This is a living document and may be updated as we progress and gather feedback.

We welcome community contributions! Please check out our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/tree/master?tab=contributing-ov-file) for guidelines on how to get started.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Now: Core Gameplay Loop (v0.1)
This milestone is focused on building the absolute minimum viable product (MVP) with a playable core loop.
- **[Core Mechanics]**:
  - Let the Player use Workers to build Farms.
  - Assign Laborers to Farms to produce Food at the start of each round.
    [Issue #4](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/issues/4)
  - Food has to move to the City to give the Player money.
    [Issue #11](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/issues/11)
  - Let the Player hire more Workers and Laborers.
- **[UI Elements]**: Add the most essential user interface elements, like letting the Player move the Units and perform actions and see territory claims on each Tile.
  [Issue #6](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/issues/6), [Issue 9](https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/issues/9)

## üîú Next: Expanding the World (v0.2)
After the core loop is solid, we'll start adding more content and expanding the game world.

## üåü Later: (v0.3+)
Start working on a unified graphics design and sounds.
