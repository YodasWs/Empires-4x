<h2>Devlog #1: Laying the Foundations</h2><p>While many games focus on the battlefields of Roman conquest, ours is about the true engine of the empire: the economy. In Empires-4x, you'll build the supply lines that turn a conquered province into a thriving part of the Roman world.</p><p>Your goal is to tame this wild frontier: connect farms and ranches to markets, defend against traveling marauders, and build roads to supply Londinium and the Roman Empire.</p><p>I'm currently building the core game loop, building the farms and collecting the food to feed your workers and ship the surplus to Londinium for profit. More challenges and depth of play is planned to follow.</p><p>You can see the early-stage <a href="https://yodasws.github.io/Empires-4x/#!/">prototype now</a>.</p><p>Follow along as I build out this game. And you can contribute your own art and code through my <a href="https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>.</p><footer><a href="#!/blog/">Blog Home</a> | <a href="#!/blog/2.html" rel="next">Next</a></footer>
