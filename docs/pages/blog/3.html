<h2>Devlog #3: A Growing Populace for Roman Britannia!</h2><p>Greetings, would-be governors of the untamed north!</p><p>Welcome back for another development update on our Roman Britain farming empire game. The legion is hard at work pushing back the frontiers, and we're excited to show you the fruits of our labor. Today, we're pulling back the curtain on some new art assets we've implemented for our units!</p><h3>👥 Meet the workers of Britannia!</h3><p>Here is a closer look at the workers who will build your sprawling rural empire, from the humble Farmer to the daring Settler.</p><img src="pages/blog/Screenshot_20250921-094652.png" height="300"> <img src="pages/blog/Screenshot_20250921-095008.png" height="300"><h3>👨‍🌾 The Farmer</h3><p>Farmers are the lifeline of the frontier. Though this unit will build and then settle in a basic Subsistence Farm, toiling to grow just enough food to keep your growing population from going hungry, Farms can be upgraded to feed your entire workforce, and export a surplus to the Empire.</p><h3>🐑 The Rancher</h3><p>More than just a herder, the Rancher is a pioneer of the wool trade. This unit will venture out to build a Sheep Ranch, where they will manage the sheep that provide the wool needed for both your local populace and for trade with the wider Roman world.</p><h3>⛏️ The Miner</h3><p>The Miner's work is the foundation of your construction efforts. This unit will build and then operate a Mine, extracting the vital Stone and Metals needed to build and upgrade your buildings, fuel your industry, and allow for a higher level of prosperity.</p><h3>🛖 The Settler</h3><p>These brave souls are the true pioneers of your empire. The Settler unit is essential for establishing new outposts and expanding your territory deeper into the wilderness of Roman Britain.</p><h3>What's next?</h3><p>We're thrilled with how these new unit images are shaping up, and we hope you are, too! Seeing our workers brought to life like this makes the world feel more vibrant and alive.</p><p><i>Cheers, and onward to prosperity!</i></p><footer><a href="#!/blog/2/" rel="prev">Previous</a> | <a href="#!/blog/">Blog Home</a> | <a href="#!/blog/4/" rel="next">Next</a></footer>
