<h2>🛠 Devlog #6: Behind the Scenes — Refactoring for the Future</h2>
<p>Hey everyone! 👋 This week’s update is less about flashy new features and more about the invisible scaffolding that makes everything else possible. I’ve been deep in the trenches refactoring the codebase — and while that might not sound glamorous, it’s a huge step toward long-term stability, scalability, and sanity.</p>
<h3>📦 Modularization: Breaking the Monolith</h3>
<p>The first big shift is breaking the monolithic, interconnected block of code into smaller, ESModule-based architecture. This means each part of the game — from UI logic to game state to rendering — now lives in its own well-defined module. It’s already making the code easier to reason about, and it sets the stage for better tooling, bundling, and testing.</p>
<h3>🧠 Functional Thinking</h3>
<p>I’m also been leaning into functional programming principles: pure functions, immutable, with clear data flow and no unintended side effects. This makes the code more reliable and predictable — which is especially important as the complexity of the game grows, reducing the mental load of adding new features.</p>
<h3>✅ Unit Tests & Integration Tests</h3>
<p>To support all this, I’ll then be able to start building out a test suite. Unit tests cover the core logic (like tile adjacency, resource yields, and action costs), while integration tests simulate real gameplay flows. This gives me confidence that changes won’t break existing systems, new features won't introduce bugs in old features — and it’ll be a lifesaver as I continue evolving the UI and mechanics.</p>
<h3>🔍 Why This Matters</h3>
<p>All of this is in service of a smoother, more maintainable game — one that’s easier to contribute to, easier to debug, and ultimately more fun to play. It’s the kind of work that doesn’t show up in screenshots, but it’s the foundation everything else rests on.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking with me through the quieter weeks. Big things are coming — and the code will be ready for them.</p>
