<h2>Devlog #4: Unit Movement Fix, and new UI Elements</h2>
<p>Hello, everyone! Another productive day has gone by, and I'm happy to report some significant quality-of-life improvements to the Empires-4x prototype.</p>
<h3>üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Unit Movement</h3>
<p>The most critical work today was fixing some pesky bugs related to unit movement from the action menu. I've spent the day tracking down and fixing that issue. You can now click or tap on a far-away hex and have your units move there over several turns!</p>
<h3>üîé Added Details in the Tile View</h3>
<p>While units were being wrangled, I also took some time to improve the UI. The tile view now displays the laborers assigned there and tells you the name of the terrain. This will give you a better understanding of the terrain and production at a glance. Information is king in a strategy game, and I'm continuing to work on presenting all the information you need.</p>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>The game is becoming more playable by the day, but there's always more work to be done. There's still a lot of core UI enhancements and core game mechanics to add.</p>
<p>You can play the latest version <a href="#!/game/">right now</a> to experience the prototype firsthand. Your feedback on these changes is invaluable, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts on <a href="https://github.com/YodasWs/Empires-4x/discussions">GitHub</a>!
