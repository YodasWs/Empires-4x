## Found a bug?

Please feel free to open a new Issue to report any bugs. Please include as much detail as possible and how to recreate it.

## Have an idea to contribute?

If you have any feature requests or ideas for the game, please open a new Discussion so we can work to flesh out if it's appropriate for the game, how it could work, and how it might be implemented in the code.

## Open Issues

Please feel free to take on any Open Issue. You can get started by following the standard workflow:
1. **Fork** the repo to your account and clone to your computer.
2. **Run** the project on your computer, as documented above.
3. **Make changes** to the appropriate files. Currently all the game logic is in `src/pages/game/ctrl.js`.
4. **Submit a Pull Request** in this project when it's ready for review.

If you have any questions or get stuck at any point, just let me know in the comments on that Issue.

## Documentation

This repo has a Wiki. Please feel help expand the information there as we develop the game.
